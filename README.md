# OpenSSH RPMs for old CentOS

For some reasons I have to maintain OpenSSH up to date packages for CentOS versions that are no longer have supports.

This openssh package has OpenSSL statically linked.

Current Version:

- OpenSSH 8.7p1
- OpenSSL 1.1.1k


Supported CentOS:

- CentOS 5
- CentOS 6
- CentOS 7
